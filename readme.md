# Phase 1 Project

## Techniques to demonstrate
3 unique click events
iterating over an array

### Summary
Use the free Dictionary API to allow one to look up a word and see the definition(s) and/or synonyms and antonyms.

#### Layout

One main page (see pdf) with one main search box (submit event) that populates the main text/results box below with the definition, etc.  Either in the main search button, or more likely, a separate dropdown (scroll event) a user can select definition/synonym/antonym to be displayed.  Once the results are displayed, a user can click a secondary button (click event) between the main search box and the main display box to move the text to the right comparison box and look up a secondary word.  There will be a list of words searched in a vertical box on the far left as an array to be iterated over for event listeners to re populate the definition in the main box when the word is clicked.  The objects that form the definition for each word could be stored in an array objects, or the fetch() GET could just be called again to bring up the definition again.

##### Future additions?

Make the pronunciation in the definition clickable to either navigate to a page where a user can hear the pronunciation or play it in an audio player (but the audio player would most likely be much more difficult and both out of my range currently)
